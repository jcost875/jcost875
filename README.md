- 👋 Hi, I’m Joe! I'm a data science enthusiast with a passion for all things technological. Every day is a chance to learn something new and I'm trying to make the most of each one so I can find technology based solutions to make the world around me a better place for all.
- 👀 Let's talk about Spotify! As an avid music lover and musician, a pet project of mine has been playing with all sorts of data from the Spotify API. There's so much information in there, maybe we can find out what your new favorite song will be!
